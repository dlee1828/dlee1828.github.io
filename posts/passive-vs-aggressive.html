vs Aggressive Strategies in High-Frequency Trading</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When thinking about HFT strategies, a useful distinction is that of
<em>passive</em> (or <em>making</em>) versus <em>aggressive</em> (or
<em>taking</em>) strategies.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Trading at the Speed of Light: How Ultrafast
Algorithms Are Transforming Financial Markets</em>, Donald Mackenzie
describes how trading groups can often be categorized based on whether
they focus on passive or aggressive strategies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, though certainly not always, trading groups and sometimes even
entire companies specialize in one or the other. For example, those
interviewees who were sufficiently senior in compartmentalized
companies—those made up of separate trading groups—to be familiar with
those groups’ trading strategies reported that groups often focused
either on making or on taking, but not both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mackenzie further notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can be large differences among companies in the proportions of
their algorithms’ trades that are making versus taking, differences that
are broadly stable over time. It is unusual for a firm to mostly make in
one month and take in the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that it is uncommon to mix the two types of strategies is
attributed to the fact that passive strategies simply look very
different from aggressive strategies. One of Mackenzie’s interviewees,
who has a senior position at a trading firm, said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there is just something that’s so different about having to
have an opinion all the time [a passive strategy] versus occasionally
having an opinion [an aggressive strategy]… for some reason those two
things can’t really be married without somehow ruining an aspect of the
other one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, the distinction between passive and aggressive
strategies provides a useful framework through which to understand a
particular trading firm’s activity. If one knows whether a trading team
is focused on passive or aggressive strategies, there is a lot that can
be subsequently inferred about the nature of that trading team’s
operations.</p>
<h2 id="passive-vs-aggressive">Passive vs Aggressive</h2>
<p>A <strong>passive</strong> strategy is one that relies on placing
limit orders in the order book and waiting for them to be filled, while
an <strong>aggressive</strong> strategy is one that relies on placing
market orders that fill existing limit orders. Sometimes, passive
strategies are described as “making” because they add liquidity, and
aggressive strategies are described as “taking” because they remove
liquidity.</p>
<p>The simplicity of this distinction belies how different passive and
aggressive strategies end up being. At first glance, it isn’t obvious
that it would be difficult for a trading algorithm to rely on both limit
orders and market orders. But we’ll soon see why this is the case.</p>
<p>Most of the time, a passive algorithm is one engaged in
market-making—the algorithm continuously posts both a bid and an ask in
the order book, updating its prices frequently based on what it sees in
the market. It doesn’t fill others’ orders; rather, it declares its
willingness to buy and sell and waits for other market participants to
engage with it. This is why the interviewee from earlier stated that a
passive strategy must “have an opinion all the time”—it is always
required to have quotes in the order book.</p>
<p>An aggressive algorithm, on the other hand, doesn’t need to submit
orders until it wants to. Most of the time, an aggressive algorithm is
observing the market and performing quantitative analysis of what it
sees. At some point, this analysis indicates that there is an
opportunity to profit—the price is about to move. So the aggressive
algorithm submits market orders, taking liquidity from the order book,
and then profits when the market moves in its favor.</p>
<p>Note: there is a certain class of aggressive strategies which aim to
identify and pick off the stale quotes of other market participants
before they have had time to update. Such strategies require little
quantitative sophistication and are highly dependent on speed, and as
such stand apart from most other aggressive strategies. For that reason,
when we refer to aggressive strategies in this essay, we usually won’t
be talking about these fast-and-dumb strategies. Yet it’s important to
note that they exist.</p>
<h2 id="hitting-singles-vs-hitting-home-runs">Hitting Singles vs Hitting
Home Runs</h2>
<p>Because passive algorithms constantly have orders in the book and
profit off of the spread, they tend to make a small amount of money on a
very consistent basis. Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, make no
money most of the time, and then make a lot of money at once. It is
common for a passive, market-making algorithm to operate in competition
with an aggressive algorithm. If an aggressive algorithm is able to
successfully out-predict a passive algorithm and buy/sell from it at a
profit, the passive algorithm has been “run over” and ends up losing a
significant amount of money. Mackenzie states that market-makers tend to
simply accept that this will happen occasionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No market-maker reported being able to entirely avoid being run over,
but all try as hard as they can, often successfully, to ensure that the
resultant losses do not fully cancel out the repeated small gains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas Cifu, CEO of Virtu Financial, once described market-making as
a business of “hitting singles.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t try to hit doubles or triples or home runs. It’s really,
really hard to be a consistent singles hitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is the case that passive strategies aim to consistently hit
singles, then aggressive strategies are those which aim to occasionally
hit a home run.</p>
<h2 id="being-fast-vs-being-smart">Being Fast vs Being Smart</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important difference between passive and aggressive
strategies is fact that passive strategies tend to be fast and dumb, and
aggressive strategies tend to be smart and slow.</p>
<p>A market-making algorithm must be fast in order to succeed. There are
two main reasons for this. The first is that it must be able to update
its quotes in real-time as quickly as possible to avoid losing money. If
there is a signal in the market indicating that a price rise is
imminent, a market-maker must adjust its prices to account for this
before other market participants (including other HFT’s) fill its
now-outdated offers. Having an opinion all the time necessitates being
able to update your opinion as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The second reason for why speed is essential to a market-maker is
because in most markets, orders at the same price level are arranged in
a time-priority queue, meaning that if a market-maker wants its orders
to be executed first at a particular price level, it must submit its
orders before anyone else. This means that there are often races between
different HFT’s to submit their orders as fast as possible to be in the
front of the queue and thus be the first to have access to a profit
opportunity.</p>
<p>This requirement for speed does not exist for an aggressive
algorithm. Once an aggressive algorithm identifies a profit opportunity,
while it is important to act on this opportunity immediately, its
ability to profit does not depend on submitting its orders as fast as is
technologically possible. If an aggressive algorithm recognizes that a
price movement will occur 1 second in the future, as long as its order
arrives before that price movement occurs, any further speedup is
unlikely to make a meaningful difference. As Mackenzie puts it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is… seldom a queue to “take.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an aggressive strategy, the key demand is quantitative
sophistication. Aggressive algorithms tend to process a large amount of
data and employ advanced statistical techniques to predict price
movements. Mackenzie describes one such algorithm that a firm uses to
predict the price movements of Treasury futures in the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The algorithm will take into account the pattern of bids, offers, and
trades in those futures, as well as patterns in the trading of the other
Treasury and interest-rate futures also traded in that datacenter. The
algorithm will receive, via microwave links, data on the buying and
selling of the underlying Treasurys, which are traded in the two
datacenters in New Jersey… Via Hibernia Atlantic’s ultrafast
transatlantic cable, it will receive data on the trading of futures on
UK sovereign bonds (these futures are traded in a datacenter just
outside of London) and the equivalent German futures, traded in a
datacenter in Frankfurt called FR2. Data on Japanese government bonds
will come from a transpacific cable and yet more microwave links. The
algorithm will continuously fuse all this information into a prediction
of the price of the futures it is trading, taking when it looks
profitable to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Mackenzie notes, it is simply not possible for a passive algorithm
to perform quantitative analysis of this sophistication due to the
requirement of speed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of this information is also available to market-making
algorithms, at least those deployed by the larger HFT firms.
Market-making algorithms, though, often have to be ultrafast (and
therefore not too complex), because of their need to be at or close to
the head of the time-priority queue for execution and the danger of
their quotes becoming stale and being picked off…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of Mackenzie’s interviewees, who works at a market-making firm,
described market-making as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We add, subtract, multiply, and divide really, really well… We’re not
doing high math and high quant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="engineering-vs-mathematics">Engineering vs Mathematics</h2>
<p>The different demands of passive and aggressive algorithms produce a
difference in the specializations of the teams and individuals working
on such strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to needing to be fast, market-making strategies must also
be extremely robust. The fact that a market-maker must constantly update
its bids and offers, typically for a variety of financial instruments
and across many different markets, places them in a highly vulnerable
position where any outage in their trading system, even lasting for only
a few seconds, could result in disastrous losses. Failure is
intolerable. The combined demands of extreme speed and extreme
robustness result in the core challenge of building passive strategies
being engineering the systems capable of executing them.</p>
<p>Aggressive strategies, in contrast, do not tend to have an
exceptional dependence on speed or robustness. As such, the core
challenge of building aggressive strategies lies in developing the
complex algorithms and mathematical models that power their price
predictions. Mackenzie writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takers, we might say, can afford to concentrate on the mathematics of
HFT, not on its engineering; makers need excellent engineering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>High-frequency trading is a rather opaque industry. Trading firms
rarely publicize details of their operations, and it can be difficult to
develop a satisfying understanding of the landscape of strategies
employed across these firms. Though I had heard of the distinction
between passive and aggressive strategies before, the thorough
discussion of this distinction in <em>Trading at the Speed of Light</em>
struck me as highly elucidating and conceptually useful. The substantial
differences between passive trading and aggressive trading are
reflections of dynamics and tradeoffs that are fundamental to HFT, and
thus by understanding these differences, we gain deep insight into the
nature of the industry as a whole.</p>
