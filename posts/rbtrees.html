id="intuitive-derivation-of-red-black-tree-balancing-operations">Intuitive
Derivation of Red-Black Tree Balancing Operations</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Red-black trees can be difficult to understand. In particular, the
operations prescribed to handle the various cases one can encounter when
performing insertions and deletions can seem pretty arbitrary and
unmotivated. In this post, I hope to provide an intuitive derivation of
these operations.</p>
<p>First, recall that a red-black tree must satisfy the following
requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every node is either red or black.</li>
<li>Null nodes (the children of leaves) are always black.</li>
<li>A red node does not have a red child.</li>
<li>Any path from the root to a null node has the same number of black
nodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will refer to number 3 as the “red rule” and number 4 as the
“black rule.”</p>
<h2 id="rotations">Rotations</h2>
<p>The core operation underpinning almost any implementation of a
self-balancing binary search tree is a <strong>rotation</strong>. A
rotation can be thought of as the simplest transformation you can
perform on a tree which preserves its binary search property.</p>
<p>This is what a rotation does:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_3.44.00_PM.png" /></p>
<p>A rotation is essentially an expression of the fact that A being a
left child of B and B being a right child of A are both valid ways to
express that A &lt; B.</p>
<p>Note that in the above example, node 2 gains a child. This is okay
because it starts off with one child. However, if it started off with
two children, we must avoid it ending up with three children. So what we
do is transfer its original second child to its grandparent when we
perform the rotation:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_3.44.19_PM.png" /></p>
<p>In this example, we’ve switched node 3 from being a child of node 2
to being a child of node 4. Observe that we’ve preserved the binary
search property because both before and after the rotation, node 3 was a
right descendant of node 2 and a left descendant of node 4.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll show the same rotation, but we’ll add an additional
child to node 4.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_3.44.34_PM.png" /></p>
<p>We refer to the above operation as “rotating node 2 into node 4.”</p>
<p>We are able to perform rotations on subtrees. So in the above image,
the nodes displayed could be part of a larger tree.</p>
<h2 id="rotate-swap-operations">Rotate-Swap Operations</h2>
<p>We will now explore how rotations interact with the black rule. Doing
so will equip us with useful insights which will aid us in rebalancing
our red-black tree in various scenarios.</p>
<p>If our original tree satisfied the black rule, then under what
circumstances would the black rule be violated after a rotation is
performed?</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_3.44.34_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Note that any path to one of our tree’s null nodes must go through
either node 1, node 3, or node 5, both before and after the rotation.
Thus it suffices to examine how the ancestors of those three nodes have
changed. We can gather the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 1 has lost node 4 as an ancestor</li>
<li>Node 5 has gained node 2 as an ancestor</li>
<li>Node 3’s ancestors have remained the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus if either node 2 or node 4 were black in the original tree, then
we’ve now violated the black rule. Otherwise, the black node counts of
all paths have remained the same and we are fine.</p>
<p>It’s now possible to observe something interesting. Consider what
happens if we swap the colors of nodes 2 and 4 after performing the
rotation. Since both nodes 2 and 4 are ancestors of node 5, node 5’s set
of ancestors isn’t altered by the swap. However, node 1’s post-rotation
parent now has node 4’s color instead of node 2’s. Thus the overall
effect of this operation now becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 1 has lost node 2 as an ancestor (or rather, it has lost a node
of node 2’s color)</li>
<li>Node 5 has gained node 2 as an ancestor</li>
</ul>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_5.01.32_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Thus we can think of what we’ve done as having “transferred” node 2
from the ancestry of node 1 to the ancestry of node 5. Thus whether or
not we’ve violated the black rule now only depends on node 2’s color. In
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>If node 2 was originally red, then the black rule has not been
violated.</li>
<li>If node 2 was originally black, then the black rule has been
violated. In particular, all paths which go through node 5 now have one
extra black node, and all paths which go through node 2 now have one
fewer black node.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to the operation of performing a rotation and then
performing a color swap as described above as a <strong>rotate-swap
operation</strong>. Moreover, when a red node is being rotated into and
then color-swapped with another node (of any color), we will refer to
the operation as a <strong>red rotate-swap</strong>, and when a black
node is being rotated into and then color-swapped with another node (of
any color), we will refer to the operation as a <strong>black
rotate-swap</strong>. We can now make the following statements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A red rotate-swap can be performed for “free” with respect to the
black rule - we can always perform this operation without changing the
black node counts of any paths (however, a red rotate-swap may still
cause us to violate the red rule, so we have to watch out for
that).</li>
<li>A black rotate-swap can be used to transfer a black node from one
subtree’s ancestry to another’s.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="insertion">Insertion</h2>
<p>We’re now ready to investigate red-black tree operations. We will
begin with insertion.</p>
<p>When we insert a node, we can choose to color it red or black.
Coloring it black will definitely violate the black rule. Coloring it
red will possibly violate the red rule. It seems easier to handle a red
rule violation than it would be to handle a black-rule violation, so we
will choose to color the node red.</p>
<p>Let the new node we’ve added be X. If X’s parent is black, then no
rule has been violated and we are done. So suppose X’s parent is red. We
must fix a red rule violation. Since X’s parent is red, we can deduce
that X’s grandparent is black. So we have some situation like this:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.16.26_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>We’ve labeled X’s parent P and X’s grandparent G. Let’s also add in
the additional (possibly null) children. We’ll leave these nodes white
to indicate that they can be any color.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.17.31_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>We need some way to separate X from P so that the two red nodes are
no longer adjacent. Recalling what we’ve just discussed about the
rotate-swap operation, we observe that because P is red, we can
rotate-swap it into G without risk of violating the black rule.
Moreover, doing so seems to fix our problem of having two adjacent red
nodes:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.19.03_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Great! We’ve just rebalanced our tree with a single rotate-swap.
There is one problem, though. If B is red, then it is now in contact
with a red node, which is not allowed. (We don’t have this issue with A
because A couldn’t have been red in the original tree).</p>
<p>So we conclude that we can only use this technique to fix our tree if
B is black.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.19.38_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Okay, so let’s think about what we can do if B is red.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.20.10_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>Here, we can do something simpler. We actually don’t need any
rotations at all. We can simply color P and B black, and then color G
red.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.20.42_PM.png" /></p>
<p>This recoloring preserves the black rule and also gets rid of the two
adjacent red nodes. It is however possible that we’re still violating
the red rule, because G’s parent in the recolored tree could be red.
However, this is fine because what we’ve essentially done is shifted our
problem two levels up the tree. Meaning we can now run our same
algorithm on the subtree two levels up. Eventually, if we recurse up to
the root, we will have a situation where the root is red and one of its
children is red, and in that situation we just color the root black and
we are done.</p>
<p>Great! We’ve now fully solved the case when we have an arrangement
like this:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.16.26_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>However, we haven’t yet considered the following possibility:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.22.19_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>X could be an “inner grandchild.” In this case, rotating-swapping X’s
parent into its grandparent won’t actually work because X will end up in
contact with a red node. Our goal is to try to transform this
arrangement into one in which our red child is an outer grandchild. It
doesn’t take long to realize that we can do this by simply
rotate-swapping X into its parent. Once again, we can do this freely
because X is red, and a red rotate-swap will not result in a black rule
violation.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.23.05_PM.png" /></p>
<p>We’re now in a situation where our red child is an outer grandchild,
which we know how to deal with. Thus we’ve now solved all possible cases
for insertion.</p>
<h2 id="deletion">Deletion</h2>
<p>Let’s now think about deletion. Nodes with at least one child can be
deleted pretty easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the node has two children, replace the node with its in-order
successor (the leftmost node in its right subtree) and then delete its
in-order successor. Note that the in-order-successor cannot have 2
children because if it did, then it would not be the leftmost node of
its subtree.</li>
<li>If the node has one child, then the node’s child must be red because
if it were black, then the black rule would be violated. Thus the node
itself must be black. So we can delete the node, replace it with its
child, and then color its child black.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the node has no children and is red, we can simply delete it.</p>
<p>If the node has no children and is black, we will need to do some
work. We begin by setting the node to null.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-24_at_6.08.30_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>Here, X is our null node. Note that X’s sibling A cannot be null
because if it was, the original tree would have violated the black
rule.</p>
<p>We are in a situation where the path from the root to X has one fewer
black node than it should. Thus we must somehow add a black node to the
path from the root to this node. This is difficult because if we simply
try to recolor a red node along this path black, we will fix the path to
X but will add an extra black node to all other paths containing that
recolored node.</p>
<p>Recall that a black rotate-swap can be used to transfer a black node
from one subtree’s ancestry to another’s. We could try to use a black
rotate-swap to add a black node to X’s ancestry. However, we would then
be left with a subtree which lacks a black node. If that subtree’s root
happened to be red, then we could recolor its root black and we would
have fixed our tree. So we seem to have solved for one possible
case:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.24.35_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Here, A is the black node being “transferred” from D’s ancestry to
X’s ancestry. We subsequently change D’s color from red to black to
restore its black node count. Note that this technique can be used to
fix our tree regardless of what P’s original color was.</p>
<p>So we seem to have solved a case where both of the following are
true:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>X’s outer nephew (D) is red.</li>
<li>X’s sibling (A) is black.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we must now consider the cases when one or both of the above
conditions aren’t true.</p>
<p>Let’s first consider what we can do if D is black:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.34.32_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>If we got X’s sibling to have a red right child instead of a black
one, we’d be able to apply the same set of operations we’ve used above
to fix the tree.</p>
<p>If C is red, it doesn’t take long to see that we can achieve this
through a red rotate-swap:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.41.23_PM.png" /></p>
<p>We can now proceed with our original strategy: rotate-swap C into P
and then recolor A to be black.</p>
<p>So what if C is black?</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.43.19_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>How we proceed will depend on the color of P. Suppose that P is
red:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.45.02_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>Here, we can fix our tree by doing something incredibly simple: swap
the colors of P and A:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.45.34_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Our tree is now fixed.</p>
<p>What if P is black?</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.46.12_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>Here, there seems to be nothing we can do. If every node is black,
how can we possibly add an additional black node to X’s ancestry?</p>
<p>We can’t. However, what we can do is shift our problem up the tree.
If we recolor A red, then we will have transformed our tree from one in
which X’s subtree is missing a black node to one in which both X’s and
A’s subtrees are missing a black node. Thus the entire subtree rooted at
P is missing a black node. We can therefore restart our algorithm but
with P as our new X. If we eventually recurse up to the root of the
tree, then we will have decreased the black node count of all paths by
one and our tree will be fixed.</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.53.42_PM.png" /></p>
<p>We’ve now fully solved the case where X’s outer nephew (D) is
black.</p>
<p>At this point, we know how to fix the tree in any of the following
cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>X’s sibling is black and X’s outer nephew is red</li>
<li>X’s sibling is black and X’s outer nephew is black</li>
</ul>
<p>So all that’s left is to figure out what we will do if X’s sibling
(A) is red. Note that X’s sibling being red fully determines the colors
of all other nodes in the diagram:</p>
<p><img
src="Red%20Black%20Trees%20148cc037f961801aaeecd7d3a7520a53/Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_12.28.39_PM.png"
width="400" /></p>
<p>In this scenario, there doesn’t seem to be much we can do. However,
because we know that we can perform a red rotate-swap for “free”, let’s
just try doing that. It may transform our tree into something that we
know how to handle:</p>
